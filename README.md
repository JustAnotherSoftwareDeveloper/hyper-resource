# hyper-resource
Angular ngResource-like provider for consuming ReST HyperMedia

# GOALS
Eventually, I want to support the major JSON formats (Siren, HAL, JSON+Collection, JSONAPI, etc)

Most of this I hope to come from the community.

For right now, it just assumes Siren (Mostly because that's the project I needed it for).

But I put in the "HyperMediaType" config setting so that later I can add more, as I leanr more about the other formats.
